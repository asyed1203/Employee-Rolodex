# Employee-Rolodex
This program calculates an employee's wages using an hourly rate, number of hours. It calculates overtime and displays the gross total. It also displays employee information such as name, address, email, phone-number, pay statement dates (start and end date). It uses six classes to do this. In the end of displaying, it will ask if you want to enter anther employee into the system, otherwise you can say no and quit. I recently added a feature where it will display all the employee information after the person hits no, while also giving an employee list of all the people that were entered.
